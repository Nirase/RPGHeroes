# RPGHeroes
 
RPGHeroes is a small system setup to handle some basic heroes. The system can handle creating a hero of different types (Warrior, Ranger, Rogue, Mage). The heroes are able to equip weapons and armor based on what their class (i.e. The Warrior can only equip Plate and Mail armor, not cloth or leather). 

Each hero has base stats based on their class, and they can gain additional stats based on the armor they're wearing and their level. Each hero gains a different amount of level up stats based on their class. The system can also calculate how much damage a hero should do and the heroes can display all their current values.
